      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Your privacy is a core principle of this app.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app is designed to work entirely offline. All data you enter is stored
        locally on your device. No personal data is transmitted to external
        servers, cloud services, or third parties.
      </p>

      <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        The app only collects the information that you explicitly choose to enter,
        such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Health or symptom entries (for example pain scores, notes, timestamps)</li>
        <li>App preferences and settings</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The app does not collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Personal identifiers such as name, email address, or phone number</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Device identifiers</li>
        <li>Usage analytics</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How Your Data Is Used</h2>
      <p>
        All data is used solely to provide the app's functionality, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Displaying your entries</li>
        <li>Generating charts, patterns, insights, or trends</li>
        <li>Improving your personal experience within the app</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Storage</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>All data is stored locally on your device using system-provided storage mechanisms</li>
        <li>No data is backed up to external servers operated by the app developer</li>
        <li>If you delete the app, all associated data is permanently removed from your device</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If your device is backed up using Apple's system services (for example
        iCloud device backups), your data may be included as part of those backups.
        This is managed entirely by Apple and subject to Apple's privacy policies.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The app does not share data with third parties</li>
        <li>The app does not sell or rent your data</li>
        <li>The app does not send data to analytics or tracking services</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Any data sharing only occurs if you explicitly choose to export or share
        information using system features.
      </p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        The app relies on the security features provided by the operating system,
        including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Device encryption</li>
        <li>App sandboxing</li>
        <li>System-level authentication (such as Face ID or Touch ID, if enabled)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While no system can guarantee absolute security, reasonable measures are
        taken to protect your data by keeping it local and isolated to your device.
      </p>

      <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        The app does not knowingly collect personal information from children. All
        data is entered manually by the user and remains on the device.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be
        reflected within the app. Continued use of the app after changes indicates
        acceptance of the updated policy.
      </p>

      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <p>
        If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact the app
        developer at:
